  description: { '$t': 'Cookie is a very sweet 3 yr old tuxedo.  She was found living on the streets of Jersey City, but a girl who is so friendly and lovable must have had a home at one time.  She greets you with conversation and loves to rub and butt heads.  Because she does love your attention, she is probably best in a home as the only cat.    Cookie is currently in foster care waiting for a home of her own.  Contact us for an easy appointment to meet her.' },
